1. In the command prompt, go to the desired directory in which you want to create react app, use the command 'npx create-react-app app_name'. Allow some time for the app to build.
2. 
3. After the app has finished building, go to App_Directory/public/index.html and copy the code that has been given inside this repository's index.html. The 'csrf' middleware token handles the computing task.
4. Once done, go to App_Directory/public/src/index.js and remove the restricted tags as given in this repository's index.js
